# Welcome to deBridge

Build once—interoperate everywhere. deBridge is a modular liquidity, messaging, bridging & interoperability layer that lets you move value and
arbitrary data across more than 30 blockchains with the security, speed, and capital‑efficiency your users expect.

## At a Glance

- IaaS (Interoperability‑as‑a‑Service) – turnkey subscription that equips any EVM or SVM chain with deBridge Messaging, DLN liquidity exchange, and dePort asset custody out‑of‑the‑box.
- DLN Liquidity Network – on‑demand, single‑transaction swaps and transfers that unlock native liquidity on any supported chain without locking assets in bridges.
- dePort – native lock‑and‑mint bridging for tokens that need canonical representation (deAssets) across chains. Ideal for protocols that want to extend token utility to new ecosystems while preserving 1:1 collateralization.
- deBridge Messaging – generalized cross‑chain calls so your smart contracts can invoke functions, mint NFTs, or trigger any business logic on a remote chain.
- Hooks Framework – programmable settlement callbacks that let you build automated trading, vault rebalancing, and other custom workflows directly into the bridge path.

Each component can be adopted individually or combined into a full cross‑chain stack that scales from simple token transfers to complex, multi‑chain dApps.

## Why Integrate deBridge?

**Plug‑and‑play chain onboarding.** IaaS makes any new blockchain fully interoperable through a single on‑chain subscription, attracting liquidity, users, and developers from day one.

**Capital‑efficient.** DLN uses just‑in‑time liquidity from market‑makers, eliminating the idle TVL and systemic risk of pooled bridges.

**Canonical & composable.** dePort guarantees every wrapped deAsset is backed 1:1 by collateral locked on the origin chain, delivering predictable liquidity and seamless composability.

**Developer‑centric.** TypeScript SDKs, REST/gRPC APIs, GraphQL subgraphs, and ready‑made React widgets help you ship in hours—not weeks.

**Battle‑tested security.** A decentralized validator set with delegated staking and on‑chain slashing backs every transaction. Security reviews by Halborn, Ackee, Zokyo, and others are publicly available.

**Universal coverage.** Support for EVM chains, Solana, Cosmos SDK networks, and emerging L2s means you reach users wherever they are.

## Core Building Blocks

### IaaS (Interoperability‑as‑a‑Service)

- One subscription deploys messaging, custody, and liquidity bridging to your chain
- Monthly or quarterly on‑chain payments; no hidden fees
- Chains gain immediate access to DLN market makers, dePort custody, and cross-chain messaging

### DLN Liquidity Network

- Spot swaps & cross‑chain payments in a single transaction
- Partial fills and RFQ pricing for best execution
- Settlement finality in seconds
- Integrate in minutes with deBridge widget

### dePort

- Lock‑and‑mint bridging model with 1:1 collateralization
- Automatic listing: first transfer deploys deAsset with metadata signed by validators
- Route deAssets between secondary chains without passing through the native chain

### deBridge Messaging

- Pass any ABI‑encoded payload between chains
- Execute multiple contract calls atomically
- Built‑in replay protection and fee abstraction

### deBridge Hooks

- Trustless callbacks at the moment of settlement
- Write hooks in Solidity or Rust and compose like Lego bricks
