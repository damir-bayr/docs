# deBridge IaaS 
deBridge IaaS (Interoperability-as-a-Service) is the first service enabling complete cross-chain interoperability for any EVM or SVM blockchain
ecosystems. It’s a turnkey solution that allows any chain to plug into deBridge infrastructure solving all three pillars of interoperability
simultaneously including transfers of authenticated messages, cross-chain asset custody, and native high-performance value exchange (liquidity
bridging).

As a complete solution, deBridge IaaS can enable any chain to become fully composable within the global DeFi ecosystem, attracting developers, users,
and liquidity from outside their ecosystem all with a subscription fee, paid on-chain. Blockchain ecosystems no longer have to solve each hurdle
individually but instead can open up to global composability from day one.

## Features and opportunities include:
- **deBridge Messaging**: Provides a decentralized infrastructure powering cross-chain message and data transfers — with authentication. deBridge
  allows smart contracts deployed across different EVM and SVM chains to establish an authenticated communication channel.
- **DLN Cross-Chain Exchange**: A high-performance cross-chain trading infrastructure built on deBridge with a unique 0-TVL design. DLN offers zero
  slippage on any order size, deeper market depth, fastest settlement times, and native asset trading without wrapped assets and risks of locked
  liquidity.
- **dePort Asset Custody**: Allows for seamless custody of assets from other networks in just one click. Projects and DAOs can scale effortlessly into
  neighboring ecosystems and create utility for their assets across different chains.

## Who is it for?
deBridge IaaS is a complete solution for any blockchain/ecosystem in the space, designed to make it easy to open up global interoperability. 

With a simple subscription fee, blockchains can solve all three interoperability challenges and make their ecosystem instantly accessible and
composable from (and between) any EVM or SVM chain. 

## Limitations
There are certain KPI criteria that need to be fulfilled by chains before they are added to the main deBridge app (https://app.debridge.finance/):
- Security
- TVL
- Daily transactions
- DAUs

In any case, your chain will be fully accessible through API and deBridge widget, and your users will be able to bridge to/from the chain directly
from your own UI/landing page with widget integrated. The chain will also be fully supported on the infrastructure level, including messaging,
deBridge custody (dePort), DLN hooks, etc.

## Pricing structure
deBridge IaaS works on a subscription-based model with monthly or quarterly payments. Any on-chain address can initialize a subscription by providing
RPC for the network and performing the payment.

The different pricing options available are:
- $11k/month with monthly payments or
- $10k/month with quarterly/yearly payments

Once the IaaS smart contract accepts the payment, and smart contracts are deployed and correctly configured, deBridge validators will automatically
pick up the blockchain and start validating messages coming to/from ecosystems. DLN market makers automatically start receiving quotes on all trades
created, receiving the ability to monetize their liquidity, and fulfill trades coming to or from a new chain. 

Be aware that deBridge validation nodes perform continuous state and balance sheet validation. If there are any inconsistencies discovered (e.g. the
total supply of dePort-issued assets calculated in the node differs from the total supply on-chain), validators will automatically stop operation for
this chain and nullify the subscription without issuing any refunds.

If a blockchain stops paying for its IaaS-subscription, there will be a grace period of a maximum of 10 days. This will allow users to derisk while
sending all pending cross-chain messages that are needed before validation fully stops. The subscription timer starts again from the moment of the 1st
validated message after the subscription was continued. 

## Risks for users
The process of IaaS subscription initialization is decentralized and performed through an IaaS smart contract, so deBridge doesn't perform due
diligence on any blockchain ecosystems connected through IaaS and doesn't bear any responsibility for the quality and validity of the data returned by
RPC of the chain, which is specified and provided by subscription governance address as one of the parameters.

Users who are interacting with any IaaS chains should do their own research about the chain and its IaaS subscription parameters such as RPC and
governance address (same as users of Uniswap who can buy any arbitrary token simply by specifying token address).
