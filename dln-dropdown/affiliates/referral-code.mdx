# Referral Codes for Integrators

When integrating deBridge into a product, the **referral code** can be attached to every order. This is more than just a way to track
traffic — it’s a powerful identifier that allows:

- **Tracking all orders created through an integration**  
- **Measure performance and usage** of an integration in real time  
- **Enable or disable certain features** on a per-integrator basis

---

## Why referral codes matter

For integrators, the referral code acts as a unique ID in the deBridge ecosystem. Every order sent with the referral code is linked back to the integration,
giving both the integrator and deBridge:

- **Analytics visibility** — see how many orders are being processed from an integration platform, along with the volumes  
- **Feature toggles** — activate or deactivate specific features for a specific integration, like [auto-cancellations](/dln-dropdown/affiliates/auto-cancellations)
- **Custom support** — faster debugging and troubleshooting when the referral code is provided

---

## Adding the referral code

When creating an order via the API, include the `referralCode`
[parameter](/dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/creating-order/api-parameters/api-parameters#referral-code) in the request.

If integrating via the [Widget](/dln-dropdown/widget/deBridge-widget), the referral code is set via `r=xxxxx` parameter.

## Tracking orders via `referralCode`

Tracking the orders via a referral code is simple, the examples can be seen [here](/dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/monitoring-orders/rest#by-referralcode)
or on [GitHub](https://github.com/debridge-finance/api-integrator-example/blob/master/src/scripts/orders/queries/get-orders-by-referral-code.ts).
