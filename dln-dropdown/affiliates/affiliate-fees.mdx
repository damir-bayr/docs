# Referral Code
To enable affiliate fees, a referral code must be included in the `create-tx` request
[parameters](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/creating-order/api-parameters/api-parameters). Further details on obtaining a referral code and its
additional use-cases are available in the Referrers and Integrators Overview sections.

# Affiliate Fees
Affiliate fees can be earned through both cross-chain and same-chain swaps by including the appropriate parameters in the request. This allows
integrators to monetize swap activity within their applications.

# Cross-Chain Affiliate Fees 
To enable affiliate fees for cross-chain swaps, the following [parameters](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/creating-order/api-parameters/api-parameters)
must be included when creating an order:
- `affiliateFeePercent`: The percentage of the order input amount allocated as the affiliate fee.
- `affiliateFeeRecipient`: The address or public key of the affiliate fee beneficiary. This must be:
  - A public key on Solana
  - A wallet address on EVM chains

Affiliate fees become available once an order reaches the `ClaimedUnlock` [state](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/monitoring-orders/order-states). 
- On EVM chains, the affiliate fee is [automatically transferred to the specified recipient when a solver claims the
  order](dln-dropdown/dln-specifics/order-fulfillment/claiming-order)
- On Solana, the fee must be withdrawn manually. Further details on withdrawing affiliate fees are provided
  [here](/affiliates/withdrawing-affiliate-fees).

# Same-Chain Affiliate Fees
The deBridge Widget also supports affiliate fee collection for same-chain swaps. These swaps use the same `affiliateFeePercent` and
`affiliateFeeRecipient` [parameters](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/creating-order/api-parameters/api-parameters), with Solana requiring additional
configuration.

## Solana
For same-chain swaps on Solana:
- The affiliateFeeRecipient must be a Jupiter referral key.
- Referral keys can be generated at https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard.
- Earned fees can be claimed via the [Jupiter Referral Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard).
