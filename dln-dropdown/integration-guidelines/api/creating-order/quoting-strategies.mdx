title: 'Quoting Strategies'
description: 'Possible quoting strategies explained in detail.'
---

DLN supports multiple quoting strategies that allow users to control how much is spent on the source chain and how much is received on the destination
chain. Each strategy is defined by how the `srcChainTokenInAmount` and `dstChainTokenOutAmount` fields are set in the order input.

## Quoting Strategies Overview

### Market Order (Recommended)

```ts
const orderInput: deBridgeOrderInput = {
  ...,
  srcChainTokenInAmount: "<fixed_amount>",
  dstChainTokenOutAmount: "auto",
  ...
};
```

* Default and most commonly used strategy.
* User defines the exact input amount.
* Protocol determines the best output amount.

✅ Recommended for most standard transfers.

Requirements:

* `srcChainTokenInAmount` = fixed numeric value
* `dstChainTokenOutAmount` = "auto"

---

### Market Order with Full Balance Utilization

```ts
const orderInput: deBridgeOrderInput = {
  ...,
  srcChainTokenInAmount: "max",
  dstChainTokenOutAmount: "auto",
  ...
};
```

* Spends the full wallet balance.
* Useful for account abstraction, batch transfers, smart wallets.

Requirements:

* `srcChainTokenInAmount` = "max"
* `dstChainTokenOutAmount` = "auto"

---

### Reverse Market Order

```ts
const orderInput: deBridgeOrderInput = {
  ...,
  srcChainTokenInAmount: "auto",
  dstChainTokenOutAmount: "<fixed_amount>",
  ...
};
```

* User specifies how much to **receive**.
* Protocol calculates how much must be spent.
* Ideal for payment flows or contract interactions.

Requirements:

* `srcChainTokenInAmount` = "auto"
* `dstChainTokenOutAmount` = fixed numeric value

---

### Limit Order (Not Recommended)

```ts
const orderInput: deBridgeOrderInput = {
  ...,
  srcChainTokenInAmount: "<fixed_amount>",
  dstChainTokenOutAmount: "<fixed_amount>",
  ...
};
```

* Defines both input and output amounts.
* Treated as a limit order.
* Will only be fulfilled if a solver accepts the exact terms.

<Warning>

Not recommended for production — risk of non-fulfillment.

</Warning>

Requirements:

* Both values must be fixed.

## Example: Order Input Structure

```ts
const arbUsdcAddress = "0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831";
const bnbUsdcAddress = "0x8ac76a51cc950d9822d68b83fe1ad97b32cd580d";
const usdcDecimals = 18;
const amountToSend = "0.01";

const amountInAtomicUnit = ethers.parseUnits(amountToSend, usdcDecimals);

const orderInput: deBridgeOrderInput = {
  srcChainId: '56',
  srcChainTokenIn: bnbUsdcAddress,
  srcChainTokenInAmount: amountInAtomicUnit.toString(),
  dstChainTokenOutAmount: "auto",
  dstChainId: '42161',
  dstChainTokenOut: arbUsdcAddress,
  dstChainTokenOutRecipient: wallet.address,
  account: wallet.address,
  srcChainOrderAuthorityAddress: wallet.address,
  dstChainOrderAuthorityAddress: wallet.address,
  referralCode: 31805
};
```

## Choosing a Strategy

| **Use Case**                       | **Recommended Strategy**        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Standard transfer with known input | Market Order                    |
| Full wallet balance transfer       | Market Order with Full Balance  |
| Target fixed destination output    | Reverse Market Order            |
| Exact 1-to-1 trade (limit)         | Limit Order *(not recommended)* |
