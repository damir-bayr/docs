# Overview
[This repository](https://github.com/debridge-finance/api-integrator-example) serves as a practical resource for integrators aiming to get 
started with hands-on examples of using the DeBridge Liqudity Network protocol via API.

More details on submitting chain-specific orders can be found [here](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/creating-order/creating-order).

# EVM
[Included](https://github.com/debridge-finance/api-integrator-example/blob/master/src/scripts/orders/example-swap.ts) is a comprehensive 
TypeScript script demonstrating the transfer of 0.1 USDC from Polygon to Arbitrum. The script outlines all necessary steps for completing 
a cross-chain swap between the two networks. It also includes examples for executing the approve function on ERC-20 tokens and showcases 
various deBridge API integrations.

# Solana
There are also examples of [creating an order from Polygon (EVM) to Solana](https://github.com/debridge-finance/api-integrator-example/blob/master/src/scripts/orders/poly-usdc-to-sol.ts) 
and [from Solana to Polygon (EVM)](https://github.com/debridge-finance/api-integrator-example/blob/master/src/scripts/orders/sol-usdc-to-poly.ts), 
along with submitting a versioned transaction.
