There are several sections to a `create-tx` response. You can see a full, real-world API response example here. They are:
## `estimation` 
This field contains gas and fee-related estimates used in the transaction planning process.

## `srcChainTokenIn`

This field is always present. Represents the structure of what the user wants to sell on the source chain.

## `costDetails`

An array describing the cost components associated with the trade. Possible entry types include: 
- `PreSwap` 
- `PreSwapEstimatedSlippage` 
- `DlnProtocolFee`
- `TakerMargin`
- `EstimatedOperatingExpenses`
- `AfterSwap`
- `AfterSwapEstimatedSlippage`

## **`tx`**
  - `data`: The data that must be signed and submitted. It contains all necessary information to initiate a [cross-chain
    order](dln-dropdown/dln-specifics/bridging-reserve-assets), including cases involving [non-reserve assets](dln-dropdown/dln-specifics/bridging-non-reserve-assets). It is
    either a calldata (for EVM-based chains) or a serialized transaction (for Solana).
  - `to`: Destination address for the transaction. Acts as the spender in the `approve` call for ERC-20 tokens. Applicable to EVM source chains only.
  - `value`: [Flat fee](dln-dropdown/overview/fees-supported-chains) in the source chain's native currency charged by the DLN protocol. Applicable to EVM source chains only.

## **`prependedOperatingExpenseCost`** 
Estimated operating cost added to the transaction, adjusted for token decimals. Present only if the request was made with `prependOperatingExpenses` enabled.

## **`order`** 
An object containing details required to facilitate the cross-chain trade.
- **`approximateFulfillmentDelay`**  
  Estimated delay, in seconds, for the order to be fulfilled.

- **`salt`**  
  Randomized value used to ensure uniqueness in the order hash.

- **`metadata`**  
  Additional contextual information about the order.

## **`orderId`**  
  A deterministic identifier for the order. The same ID is used on both source and destination chains and can be used to [track order
  status](dln-dropdown/integration-guidelines/api/monitoring-orders/rest).

## **`fixFee`**  
  [Flat fee](dln-dropdown/overview/fees-supported-chains) charged in the source chain's native currency. This matches `tx.value` for EVM-based chains.

## **`userPoints`**  
  The number of deBridge points that the user will get for this trade.

## **`integratorPoints`**  
  The number of deBridge points that the integrator will get for this trade.
