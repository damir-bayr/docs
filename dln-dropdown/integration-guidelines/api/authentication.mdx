The DLN API is open to everyone with a limited RPS and doesn't require authentication. To make sure we keep delivering a high-quality service, we've introduced a requirement for commercial integrations to authenticate requests with dedicated API keys.

Please fill in the Authentication Request form so we can provide you with a dedicated API key and custom limits.
