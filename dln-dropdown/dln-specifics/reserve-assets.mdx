[DeBridge Liquidity Network (DLN)](/overview/introduction) operates as a free and competitive market where solvers fulfill cross-chain 
orders if doing so is profitable. Solvers are responsible for covering the order execution costs (gas fees). These costs include 
transferring the bridged assets to the beneficiary on the destination chain, as well as the fees required to claim the assets that were 
initially bridged by the user on the source chain. These combined expenses constitute the [operating expenses](/overview/fee-structure) for solvers.

<Tip>
Although DLN enables the bridging of arbitrary liquid assets across supported networks, settlement between chains is always performed 
in a limited set of predefined tokens known as reserve assets.
</Tip>

To reduce operational complexity, DLN is designed such that solvers only need to maintain liquidity in a small set of reserve assets. 
These assets currently include:
- ETH on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Linea
- wETH on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon
- USDC (issued by Circle Inc.) on all DLN-supported chains

This model ensures reliable settlement and minimizes the capital management burden on solvers while still supporting a wide variety of 
bridged tokens. Further details about operating costs and fees are available [here](/overview/fees-supported-chains).
